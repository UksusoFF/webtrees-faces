## Updated Added "Age at" 

An image/ photo must be attached to a FACT/EVENT only needs to be attached to ONE person

Put a date or just a year in the Date field of the Fact object attach a Media object to the fact save

you can all add a note to the FACT and also add a place to the fact

once the face has been tagged it will display the age when you mouse over base on date of birth - date in the FACT (should be date it was taken)

![young as](https://github.com/MYLE-01/webtrees-faces/assets/4362345/6f1a8d06-68bb-4bb9-88e2-407a8a44ca7b)

My logic think is if they are not dead dont show the lifeSpan

![notdead](https://github.com/MYLE-01/webtrees-faces/assets/4362345/cffce71f-1ae5-44ce-964e-43e1d7a82fdb)

and if they are dead it will show there age plus there lifeSpan

if person missing date of birth it still you 
if date missing in fact it tell you
